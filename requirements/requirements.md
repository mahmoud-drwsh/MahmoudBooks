# Introduction

In order to save myself the time needed for collecting and specifying user requirements, I got the idea to instead just clone an already popular app. The app I chose is Amazon Kindle. By analyzing the UI, the requirements can be reversed engineered. 

# Reverse-engineered user requirements
## On the home screen, the user should be shown:
1. A list of the favorite books filterable by category
   - The choice of category should be modifiable by clicking on a desired chip by the user.
   
## On the store screen, the user should be shown:
1. A search bar
2. The list of found books 

## On the settings screen, the user should be shown:
1. An option for changing the UI mode from dark to light and vice versa.
